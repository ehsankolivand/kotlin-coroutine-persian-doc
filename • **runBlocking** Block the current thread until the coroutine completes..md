runBlocking is a function in Kotlin’s coroutines library that initiates a new coroutine and blocks the current thread until its execution completes. This function serves as a bridge between regular blocking code and code written in a suspending style, making it particularly useful in main functions and unit tests.

  

**Key Characteristics of** runBlocking**:**

• **Thread Blocking:** Unlike other coroutine builders that suspend execution, runBlocking blocks the thread on which it operates until the coroutine finishes. This means that while the coroutine is active, the thread is occupied and cannot perform other tasks.

• **Usage Context:** runBlocking is typically employed in scenarios where a coroutine needs to be launched from a non-coroutine context, such as the main function of a program or within unit tests. It allows for the execution of suspending functions in these contexts without requiring the entire environment to support coroutines.

• **Not for Use Within Coroutines:** It’s important to avoid using runBlocking within an existing coroutine. Doing so would block the thread, which contradicts the non-blocking nature of coroutines and can lead to issues like thread starvation.

  

**Example Usage:**

  

import kotlinx.coroutines.*

  
```

fun main() {

    runBlocking {

        launch {

            delay(1000L)

            println("World!")

        }

        println("Hello")

    }

}
```

  

In this example:

• runBlocking starts a new coroutine and blocks the main thread until its completion.

• Within runBlocking, a new coroutine is launched using launch, which is a non-blocking coroutine builder.

• The delay(1000L) function suspends the coroutine for 1 second without blocking the thread.

• The output will be:

  

```
Hello

World!

```
  

This demonstrates that “Hello” is printed immediately, and after a 1-second delay, “World!” is printed.

  

**Best Practices:**

• **Main Functions and Tests:** Use runBlocking in main functions and unit tests to bridge blocking and non-blocking code.

• **Avoid in Suspending Contexts:** Do not use runBlocking within suspending functions or coroutines, as it can lead to blocking the thread and potential performance issues.

• **Structured Concurrency:** Prefer using coroutine builders like launch or async within coroutine scopes to maintain non-blocking behavior and leverage structured concurrency.
